# Contributing to cse.iiitdmj.ac.in

We love pull requests from everyone.


Here are some ways *you* can contribute:

* by devloping admin's panel that can perform CRUD operations for the records of students, staff and faculties.
* by developing a common template of faculty portfolio and the corresponding database migration.
* by reporting bugs
* by suggesting new features
* by writing or editing documentation
* by writing specifications
* by writing code ( **no patch is too small** : fix typos, add comments, clean up inconsistent whitespace )
* by refactoring code
* by closing [issues][]
* by reviewing patches

## Submitting an Issue
We use the [GitHub issue tracker][issues] to track bugs and features. Before

already been submitted. When submitting a bug report, please include a [Gist][]
that includes a stack trace and any details that may be necessary to reproduce
the bug, including your laravel version and operating system.
Ideally, a bug report should include a pull request with failing specs.
